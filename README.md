## Features

With the focus on speed and usability, Phanary offers features like:

* Atmospheres: intuitively group sounds and music into soundscapes, then fade between them with the click of a button
* One-shots: manually fire a cinematic suspense tone after a plot twist, or set the sound of pouring ale to play every 15 to 30 seconds
* Auto-play: with results that update as-you-type, assemble and play a convincing soundscape in seconds
* Customization: change one-shots frequencies, tweak track volumes, rename atmospheres, and recreate specific settings from your campaign through rich sound layering
